## Cereal Yield Forecasting in Tunisia

# 1. A simple 90-second opening answer

**Question: Can you introduce your project?**

**Answer:**

My project is called the Tunisia Cereal Yield Forecasting Framework, or TCYFF.

The problem is that cereal yield changes between governorates and harvest years because of rainfall, temperature, vegetation, soil conditions, regional differences, and previous agricultural performance. A national average can also hide important regional differences.

The solution is an end-to-end machine-learning decision-support system. It combines six agricultural and environmental data sources into one governorate-year dataset. It prepares historical features, removes current-year outcome columns that could cause data leakage, and compares several regression models using Leave-One-Year-Out validation.

The selected deployed model is an ExtraTrees Regressor. It achieved an RMSE of 4.097 qx/ha, an MAE of 2.925 qx/ha, and an R² of 0.758.

The final model is saved as a reusable pipeline and is connected to a Streamlit dashboard and a FastAPI REST API. The dashboard also includes national aggregation, error analysis, feature importance, and an experimental drought-risk prototype.

---
# The main beneficiaries are:

1. Agricultural analysts — they can study yield patterns and compare regions.
2. Government planners and decision-makers — they can identify governorates or years that may need more attention.
3. Researchers and universities — they can use the project for agricultural and machine-learning studies.
4. Data scientists and developers — they can reuse the model, dashboard, and API.
5. Agricultural organisations — they can use the results to support monitoring and planning.
6. Farmers indirectly — they may benefit from better decisions, but the model does not predict at individual farm level.

# Part A — 30 main technical questions

## 1. What problem does the project solve?

The project addresses the difficulty of forecasting cereal yield across Tunisian governorates.

Yield changes because of rainfall, heat, vegetation, soil conditions, regional differences, and previous agricultural performance. The available dataset is also relatively small and covers different years and regions.

The system estimates yield at governorate level instead of using only a national value, because national values can hide regional differences.

---

## 2. What is the proposed solution?

The solution is an end-to-end decision-support framework.

It:

- combines agricultural and environmental data,
- creates one structured governorate-year dataset,
- prepares safe historical features,
- removes current-year outcome columns,
- compares several regression models,
- validates them by harvest year,
- saves the selected model,
- presents results in a dashboard,
- exposes predictions through an API.

---

## 3. What exactly does the model predict?

The model predicts:

```text
Target_Total_Yield_QxHa
```

This is the aggregate yield of:

- durum wheat,
- soft wheat,
- barley.

The unit is quintals per hectare, written as `qx/ha`.

---

## 4. What does one observation represent?

One observation represents:

```text
one governorate + one harvest year
```

For example, Beja in 2015 is one observation.

---

## 5. What is the dataset size?

The processed CSV contains:

- 342 candidate rows,
- 131 columns.

After removing rows without a valid target, the modelling data contains:

- 338 supervised observations,
- 18 governorates,
- years from 2002 to 2020,
- 123 approved input features.

---

## 6. Which data sources were used?

Six main sources were combined:

- ONAGRI for agricultural statistics,
- CHIRPS for rainfall,
- ERA5 for climate and temperature,
- MODIS for vegetation,
- SoilGrids for soil information,
- OpenLandMap for additional soil information.

---

## 7. Why use several data sources?

Cereal yield is not controlled by one factor.

Rainfall, temperature, vegetation condition, soil properties, location, and previous agricultural performance can all affect the result.

Combining several sources gives the model a wider view of the conditions in each governorate and year.

---

## 8. What is the system architecture?

The architecture has four main layers:

1. **Data layer:** source data and the processed CSV.
2. **Machine-learning layer:** cleaning, historical features, leakage filtering, model comparison, and final training.
3. **Persistence layer:** the saved Joblib pipeline, JSON metadata, and result CSV files.
4. **Application layer:** the Streamlit dashboard and FastAPI REST API.

The dashboard uses the dataset, saved results, and saved model. The API mainly uses the saved model and metadata.

---

## 9. What are the main steps of the pipeline?

The main steps are:

1. load the processed CSV,
2. clean column names and important values,
3. remove rows without the target, year, or governorate,
4. sort by governorate and year,
5. create historical features,
6. remove leakage and metadata columns,
7. separate inputs `X` from target `y`,
8. identify numeric and categorical columns,
9. fill missing values,
10. one-hot encode categories,
11. train the ExtraTrees model,
12. save the full pipeline and metadata.

---

## 10. What methodology was used?

The machine-learning project follows **CRISP-DM**.

CRISP-DM means Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining.

Its phases are:

1. business understanding,
2. data understanding,
3. data preparation,
4. modelling,
5. evaluation,
6. deployment.

Kanban was used separately to organise the implementation tasks and monitor progress.

---

## 11. How was CRISP-DM applied?

### Business understanding

The agricultural problem was translated into a regression task: predict governorate-level cereal yield in qx/ha.

### Data understanding

The project checked the years, governorates, target distribution, missing values, and feature groups.

### Data preparation

The datasets were cleaned and combined. Historical features were created and leakage-related columns were removed.

### Modelling

Several regression models and simple baselines were tested.

### Evaluation

Leave-One-Year-Out validation and regression metrics were used.

### Deployment

The selected model was saved and connected to Streamlit and FastAPI.

---

## 12. Why was Kanban used?

CRISP-DM explains the data-science lifecycle.

Kanban helps manage the actual work.

It was used to divide the project into smaller tasks such as:

- data cleaning,
- feature engineering,
- model testing,
- dashboard development,
- API development,
- documentation,
- testing and corrections.

---

## 13. What is data leakage?

Data leakage happens when the model receives information that already reveals the answer.

For example, using current-year cereal production or current-year crop yield to predict the same year's total yield would make the test result unrealistic.

The model might look accurate because it has been given part of the answer.

---

## 14. How did you reduce leakage?

The code removes:

- the target,
- current-year crop yield,
- current-year production,
- current-year cultivated area,
- current outcome shares,
- target-related proxy variables,
- some metadata columns.

It then creates historical features using earlier observations.

The exact removed columns are saved in:

```text
results/01_dropped_leakage_columns.csv
```

---

## 15. What are historical features?

Historical features describe what happened earlier in the same governorate.

Examples are:

- previous yield,
- yield from two years earlier,
- previous production,
- previous cultivated area,
- rolling three-year mean,
- rolling five-year mean,
- expanding historical mean.

These features help the model learn regional patterns over time.

---
---

## 17. How are missing values handled?

For numeric columns, missing values are replaced with the median.

The median is used because it is not strongly pulled by unusually large or small values.

For categorical columns, missing values are replaced with the most frequent category.

The categories are then converted into numbers using one-hot encoding.

---

## 18. Why use one-hot encoding?

Models need numeric input.

One-hot encoding turns a category into separate 0/1 columns.

For example:

```text
Governorate = Beja
```

can become:

```text
Governorate_Beja = 1
Governorate_Kef = 0
```

This lets the model use text categories without treating them as an ordered number.

---

## 19. What validation method was used?

The project uses Leave-One-Year-Out validation, or LOYO.

In each round:

- one complete harvest year is held out,
- the other years are used for training,
- the model predicts the held-out year.

The process repeats until every year has been tested once.

---

## 20. Why not use a random split?

A random split can place records from the same harvest year in both training and testing.

Those records may share similar rainfall and national climate conditions.

This can make performance look more optimistic.

LOYO tests whether the model can generalise to a complete unseen year.

---

## 21. Which models were tested?

The report describes:

- Ridge Regression,
- Random Forest,
- Gradient Boosting,
- XGBoost Regularized,
- LightGBM Regularized,
- ExtraTrees,
- historical formulas,
- simple baselines,
- weighted blends.

---

## 22. Which evaluation metrics were used?

The main metrics are:

- RMSE,
- MAE,
- R².

The report also discusses MAPE, but the final comparison table mainly uses RMSE, MAE, and R².

---
## 23. What do RMSE, MAE, and R² mean?

### MAE

MAE tells us the model’s **average mistake**.

For example, an MAE of **2.925 qx/ha** means:

> On average, the prediction is about 2.9 qx/ha away from the real yield.

Lower is better.

---

### RMSE

RMSE also measures prediction error, but it gives **more attention to very large mistakes**.

For example, an RMSE of **4.097 qx/ha** means that some larger errors increased the overall score.

Lower is better.

**Simple difference:**

* MAE shows the normal average error.
* RMSE is more affected by large errors.

---

### R²

R² shows how well the model understands the differences between low-yield and high-yield observations.

An R² of **0.758** means:

> The model explains about 75.8% of the changes and differences seen in cereal yield.

Higher is better.

It does **not** mean that every prediction is 75.8% correct.


---

## 24. What are the final ExtraTrees results?

The selected ExtraTrees model achieved:

| Metric | Result |
|---|---:|
| RMSE | 4.0971 qx/ha |
| MAE | 2.9248 qx/ha |
| R² | 0.7584 |

---

## 25. What is ExtraTrees?

ExtraTrees is an ensemble regression model.

An ensemble combines many decision trees instead of trusting one tree.

ExtraTrees also adds randomness when choosing features and split points. The final prediction is the average result from the trees.

This helps it model nonlinear relationships and interactions.

---

## 26. What are the main ExtraTrees settings?

```python
ExtraTreesRegressor(
    n_estimators=800,
    random_state=42,
    min_samples_leaf=2,
    max_features="sqrt",
    n_jobs=-1,
)
```

Simple meaning:

- 800 trees are built,
- each final leaf has at least two rows,
- each split checks only a subset of features,
- the fixed seed supports repeatability,
- all CPU cores are used.

---

## 27. Why was standard ExtraTrees selected if another result was slightly better?

The deeper ExtraTrees variant had a slightly lower RMSE, and one blend had a slightly lower MAE.

The standard ExtraTrees model was still selected because:

- its results were close to the best ones,
- it required only one model,
- it was easier to save and load,
- it was easier to maintain,
- it provided feature importance,
- it integrated cleanly with the dashboard and API.

The choice considered both performance and deployment simplicity.

---
# Biggest technical challenge

The biggest technical challenge was combining several different data sources while avoiding target leakage.

The sources had different formats, column names, time coverage, missing values, and measurement types.

Also, agricultural production, cultivated area, and yield are mathematically related. If current-year production or area is included, the model may indirectly see the answer.

I solved this by:

- standardising governorate names,
- checking required columns,
- checking unique merge keys,
- building one canonical dataset,
- removing current-year outcome columns,
- using historical features,
- evaluating with LOYO.
## 28. What is the difference between evaluation and final training?

Evaluation uses LOYO to estimate performance on unseen years.

After the model type is selected, `train_final_model.py` fits the final pipeline on all 338 supervised observations.

The saved final model is used for deployment.

The evaluation metrics come from the validation process, not from fitting on all rows and testing on the same rows.

---

## 29. What does the dashboard show?

The dashboard has these sections:

- Overview,
- National View,
- Drought Risk Prototype,
- Model Performance,
- Feature Importance,
- Regional Insights,
- Single Prediction,
- API / Deployment Notes.

It combines model results, charts, error analysis, predictions, and deployment information.

---

## 30. What is the REST API used for?

The API allows another application to request a prediction through HTTP.

It accepts JSON input, places the values in the correct feature order, passes them through the saved preprocessing and ExtraTrees pipeline, and returns a JSON prediction.

FastAPI also creates automatic documentation at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```
# Honest limitation answer

**Question: What would you improve next?**

**Answer:**

I would add newer data, build separate models for each cereal crop, show prediction ranges, add more testing and monitoring, and improve the validation process.

At the moment, the project removes current-year information that could reveal the answer, and the historical features only use earlier years.

In the future, I would create those historical features separately inside each validation round. This would make the evaluation even stricter and more reliable.

---














# Part B — 20 backup code and implementation questions

## 31. What does `load_raw_data()` do?

It:

1. reads the CSV with pandas,
2. removes spaces from column names,
3. converts the year and target to numeric values,
4. removes rows missing the target, year, or governorate,
5. converts the year to an integer,
6. sorts the data by governorate and year.

Sorting is necessary before historical features are created.

---

## 32. Why use `pd.to_numeric(..., errors="coerce")`?

It safely converts values to numbers.

When a value cannot be converted, it becomes `NaN` instead of stopping the program with an error.

The code can then remove or handle that missing value in a controlled way.

---

## 33. Why sort by governorate and year?

Lag and rolling features depend on order.

The code must know which record came earlier for each governorate.

Without sorting, the “previous year” value could be taken from the wrong row.

---

## 34. Why use `df.copy()`?

`df.copy()` creates a separate DataFrame.

This prevents a function from unexpectedly changing the original table that was passed into it.

It makes the code safer and easier to understand.

---

## 35. What does `add_safe_historical_features()` do?

It groups records by governorate and creates historical variables such as:

- lag-one yield,
- lag-two yield,
- rolling yield means,
- expanding yield mean,
- previous production,
- previous cultivated area,
- historical production-to-area formulas.

The word `SAFE` means the feature is intended to use earlier observations rather than the current target.

---

## 36. Why use `groupby(Governorate)`?

Historical patterns must be calculated separately for each governorate.

Without grouping, the previous row for Beja could incorrectly come from Kef or another governorate.

---

## 37. Why use `min_periods=1` in a rolling mean?

The earliest records may not have three or five earlier years available.

`min_periods=1` allows the rolling mean to be calculated using the earlier values that do exist.

Without it, many early rows would remain missing.

---

## 38. Why does the code check whether a column exists?

Some versions of the dataset may not contain every optional production or area column.

The condition:

```python
if "column_name" in df.columns:
```

prevents the program from crashing and makes the function more flexible.

---

## 39. What does `prepare_training_data()` do?

It connects the preparation steps.

It:

1. loads the CSV,
2. adds historical features,
3. finds the leakage columns that exist,
4. removes them from the feature list,
5. creates `X`,
6. creates `y`,
7. returns the prepared DataFrame, feature names, and removed columns.

---

## 40. What are `X` and `y`?

`X` is the table of input features.

Examples include rainfall, vegetation, soil, governorate, and historical values.

`y` is the correct target the model learns to predict:

```text
Target_Total_Yield_QxHa
```

---

## 41. Why use `ColumnTransformer`?

Numeric and categorical columns need different preparation.

`ColumnTransformer` applies:

- median imputation to numeric columns,
- most-frequent imputation and one-hot encoding to categorical columns.

It then combines the prepared columns into one model input table.

---

## 42. Why use a scikit-learn `Pipeline`?

The pipeline keeps preprocessing and the model together.

This ensures that the same missing-value handling and encoding are used during:

- training,
- dashboard predictions,
- API predictions.

It reduces the risk of inconsistent preparation.

---

## 43. Why use `handle_unknown="ignore"`?

A new prediction could contain a category that was not present during training.

Without this setting, one-hot encoding could fail.

With `ignore`, the unknown category does not crash the pipeline. However, a prediction for an unseen governorate should still be treated carefully.

---

## 44. Why use `remainder="drop"`?

It tells `ColumnTransformer` to exclude any column that was not explicitly assigned to the numeric or categorical preparation groups.

This keeps the final model input controlled.

---

## 45. What does `train_final_model.py` do?

It:

1. calls `prepare_training_data()`,
2. identifies numeric and categorical columns,
3. builds the preprocessing and ExtraTrees pipeline,
4. trains it on all supervised observations,
5. saves the pipeline as a Joblib file,
6. saves metadata as JSON.

---

## 46. Why save the model with Joblib?

Joblib can save and reload trained Python machine-learning objects efficiently.

In this project, it saves the complete pipeline, not only the ExtraTrees object.

That means the imputation and encoding steps are saved with the model.

---

## 47. Why save `model_metadata.json`?

The JSON file provides readable information about the model.

It includes:

- target name and unit,
- feature order,
- numeric and categorical columns,
- removed columns,
- training-row count,
- model name and version information.

The API uses the feature order to rebuild prediction requests correctly.

---

## 48. What do the dashboard loading functions do?

### `load_model()`

Loads the Joblib model and JSON metadata.

It uses `@st.cache_resource` because the model is a large reusable object.

### `load_data()`

Loads the CSV and adds historical features.

It uses `@st.cache_data` because it returns DataFrames.

### `load_csv_if_exists()`

Loads a result CSV only when it exists. Otherwise, it returns `None` so the dashboard can show a readable warning.

---

## 49. What do `build_national_view()` and `build_drought_risk()` do?

### `build_national_view()`

It combines governorate predictions into one annual national estimate.

It prefers an area-weighted average. If valid area values are unavailable, it uses a simple average.

### `build_drought_risk()`

It creates an experimental score from rainfall, vegetation, soil-water, and heat indicators.

It is transparent and rule-based. It is not the ExtraTrees model and is not an official drought-warning system.

---

## 50. What does the API `predict()` function do?

It:

1. checks that the request is not empty,
2. checks that at least one feature name is recognised,
3. rebuilds the row in the exact training feature order,
4. fills missing expected values with `NaN`,
5. converts the row into a pandas DataFrame,
6. calls `model.predict()`,
7. returns the prediction and information about missing or extra features.

A set called `FEATURE_SET` is used because checking membership in a set is fast.

---

# 8. Short answers to memorise

## Why ExtraTrees?

It handled nonlinear relationships well, produced strong LOYO results, provided feature importance, and was simple to deploy.

## Why LOYO?

It tests performance on a complete unseen harvest year.

## Why not a random split?

A random split can mix similar yearly conditions between training and testing.

## What is leakage?

Information that reveals the target or would not realistically be available at prediction time.

## What is a pipeline?

A saved sequence that applies preprocessing and then prediction in the same way every time.

## Why median imputation?

The median is less affected by extreme values.

## Why one-hot encoding?

It converts text categories into numeric 0/1 columns.

## Why 123 inputs but 143 importances?

One-hot encoding expands categorical columns.

## Is the drought score part of ExtraTrees?

No. It is a separate experimental rule-based module.

## Is the system fully production-ready?

It is a complete academic prototype. A production system would still need stronger validation, monitoring, security, automated tests, and regular retraining.
